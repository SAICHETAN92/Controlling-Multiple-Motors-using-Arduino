# Programming-Multiple-Motors-using-Arduino
### This simple project shows programming four different motors using Arduino. It is not possible to program four motors at a time using a general purpose Arduino controller, because the power supply will not be sufficient to drive four motors. So, it is suggested to use an external power supply to satisfy the power requirements. Now we will see the list of basic components that needed for this simple project.

# List of Components/Materials Required:
- General purpose Arduino UNO
- DC Motors (4)
- Bread Board
- Connecting Wires
- External Power Supply

## The figure given below shows The Circuit Diagram.

## Now we will see the basic explanation of the Arduino Proragam.
### It is must that we define a buit-in library called `#include <Servo.h>` to use the motors.
